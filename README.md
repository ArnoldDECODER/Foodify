# Foodify Website

## Overview

Foodify is a web application built with React that allows users to explore, search, save, and view recipes. It features a dynamic homepage with a carousel of trending recipes, a real-time search bar, a favourites page, and detailed recipe views. The application uses React Router for navigation, Redux for managing favourites, and Axios for fetching data from a local `recipes.json` file.

## Features

- **Homepage Carousel:** Displays trending recipes (3 at a time on large screens, 1 at a time on small screens). Users can navigate using arrow buttons.
- **Favourites:** Tap the heart icon to add/remove recipes. Stored in Redux with localStorage for persistence.
- **Search Bar:** Located in the header. Searches `recipes.json` and shows matching recipes or a "recipe not available" message.
- **Recipe Details:** Click "View Recipe" to see full details like image, ingredients, steps, and video guide.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout with icon-only navbar on smaller screens.
- **Persistent Favourites:** Favourites are retained after page reload using `localStorage`.
- **Rating and Comments:** Users can rate and comment on recipes, view their own comments, and delete them with confirmation prompts.
- **YouTube Video Integration:** Each recipe includes an embedded video for visual guidance.
